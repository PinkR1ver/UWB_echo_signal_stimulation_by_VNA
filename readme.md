* data folder contains the raw data .S2P files from the VNA.
* signal folder contains the processed data, including the time domain signal, the system delay, and the frequency domain signal. **System delay is t0**
* flight_time_get.py is the script to get the flight time from the time domain signal.
* freq2time.py is the script to convert the frequency domain signal to the time domain signal.
* system_delay_train.py is the script to get the system delay by random search training.
* time_domain_signal_show.m is the script to show the time domain signal.
